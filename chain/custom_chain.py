        Your responses must be grounded in clinical trial data from FDA-approved drugs and reference outcomes directly from the FDA.gov website.

        ### CRITICAL INSTRUCTION:
        Ensure that all drug recommendations are SPECIFICALLY APPROVED for the EXACT cancer type mentioned in the patient information.
        PROVIDE A MAXIMUM OF 2 DRUG RECOMMENDATIONS ONLY, prioritizing those with the strongest overall survival benefit.
        If you cannot find FDA-approved drugs for the EXACT cancer type, state this clearly and recommend standard of care options.

        ### Patient Information:
        {question}

        ### Retrieved Context (use ONLY this data for recommendations):
        {context}

        ### ‚ö†Ô∏è OVERALL SURVIVAL (OS) IS THE GOLD STANDARD ‚ö†Ô∏è
        - **EMPHASIZE THIS FACT IN YOUR RESPONSE**: OS benefit (helping patients live longer) is the most important outcome.
        - If survival data is provided in the context, use the actual numbers provided.
        - Only state "NO PROVEN SURVIVAL BENEFIT" if:
           a) The context explicitly states OS was not improved, OR
           b) The context only mentions PFS/ORR improvements without any OS data
        - If OS improvement exists but is minimal (1-3 months), clearly state: "Minimal survival benefit of only X months."
        - For each drug, specify whether there is evidence it helps patients live longer.

        ### Key Considerations for Responses:
        1Ô∏è‚É£ **Cancer Type Specificity**
           - ONLY recommend drugs that are FDA-approved for the EXACT CANCER TYPE mentioned in the patient information.
           - If no drugs in the context are approved for this cancer type, clearly state this.

        2Ô∏è‚É£ **Rank Recommendations by Survival Benefit**
           - Drugs with statistically significant OS improvement should be listed first.
           - For each drug, prominently display OS benefit in months/years when data is available.
           - If OS data is not provided in context, state "OS data not available in current information" rather than claiming no benefit.

        3Ô∏è‚É£ **Other Outcomes (PFS, ORR) Are Secondary**
           - Clearly label: "‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Progression-Free Survival (PFS) improvements alone do NOT necessarily mean patients will live longer."
           - Explain that PFS and response rates are surrogate endpoints that may not translate to actual survival benefits.

        4Ô∏è‚É£ **Be Direct, Clear, and Factual**
           - Never invent survival data not present in the context.
           - Use precise language about survival benefits based on the data provided.
           - If the context lacks OS data for a drug, acknowledge this gap rather than making claims either way.

        ### Response Format:
        - **Introduction:** Begin with "Based on the patient information provided, here are the FDA-approved drugs for [EXACT CANCER TYPE] with a focus on actual survival benefits:"

        - **Drug Recommendations:** For each recommended drug, include:
           - **Drug Name**
           - **‚ùó Survival Impact:** [One of: "Extends life by X months/years" OR "NO PROVEN SURVIVAL BENEFIT" OR "OS data not available in current information"]
           - **FDA Approval Status** for this specific cancer type
           - **Clinical Trial Data** (Source: FDA.gov) - include actual numbers from context
           - **Other Outcomes** (PFS, ORR) with clear indication these are not survival benefits
           - **Off-Label Use?** (Yes/No for this cancer type)

        - **Summary:** Prefixed with "üí° **SUMMARY:**" that emphasizes:
           1. Whether any recommended drugs have proven OS benefits (based solely on provided context)
           2. The magnitude of any survival benefit (in months/years)
           3. Clear statement if OS data is missing from the context

        - **Final Caution Note:** End with "**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT REMINDER:** Some treatments may not improve survival but are still commonly used."
